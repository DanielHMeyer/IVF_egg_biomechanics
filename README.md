# IVF Egg Biomechanics
## Description
Predicting the reproductive potential of human eggs (oocytes) based on their biomechanical parameters.
This repository contains code to:
* Analyze videos of aspiration depth measurements and extract properties of the measurement
* Model the biomechanical characteristics of an oocytes
* Train machine learning classifiers to predict the reproductive potential of the oocytes.

## Installation

## Usage
Run menu.py to load measurement data, analyze measurements and train supervised machine learning classifiers.
